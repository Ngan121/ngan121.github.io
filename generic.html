									<h1>This is<br />
									My True Color</h1>
									<p>With the natural curiosity, I satisfy my "hunger" brain by<br />
										self-learning everything that I found interested in . Also, investigating<br />
										for myself knowledge and skills that are essential for developing my career path.</p>

									Highly responsible, observing, and ambitious individual who always strives to achieve goals are things that may sharp myself. I'm a person who can get on greatly with new environments or new things come in so I'm not exhausted or get stressed when new comes around (as a result of working in a start up company). I can say in confidence that I work best in both individual or group work.<br/> 
									As an introvert, I seek for a frictionless environment, a spirit of friends helping friends to get the job done. Close-knit and supportive teams are what I enjoy most, allowing me to express my altruistic spirit among people who rely on my dedication and warmth. Also, a place with lots of clever and proficient people always make me satisfied the most. Working with those people not only makes me feel excited, energetic but also can improve myself better by learning from them :)</p>

								<p>For me, a "fresh look" will never actually succeed in changing people's perspective if they are unaware of the "storytelling" that goes with it, and marketing is a way to "tell" the story to connect people's thoughts into the fresh look you are trying to express. Taking it into consideration, I decided to major in marketing as well as self-learning graphic design.
									With the itch for wanting to learn and to know about everything, I finished my degree within 2 years and started looking for oppoturnity of working and meeting excellent people out there.</p>

												<b><li>Adobe Photoshop</li></b>

											</header>
											<p>I have always been fascinated by how design can impact a person's emotions and experiences. Whether it's a well-designed product, a visually stunning website, or an eye-catching poster, good design has the power to capture attention and leave a lasting impression. It's this ability to create something that resonates with people on a deeper level that motivates me to continue improving my design skills.
												While I may not have a formal design education, I believe that my passion for design and my willingness to learn has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in various design principles. I regularly seek out new design trends and techniques to stay up-to-date with the latest industry developments.												
												One of the most rewarding aspects of design for me is being able to bring someone's vision to life. Whether it's a client's vision for their brand or an idea for a personal project, I enjoy the challenge of taking abstract concepts and turning them into concrete designs.</p>
												<b><li>Self Learning</li></b>
											</header>
											<p>My insatiable curiosity drives me to constantly seek out new opportunities to learn and expand my knowledge. I am never content with what I already know and am always looking for ways to push my boundaries and broaden my horizons.
												Through my pursuit of knowledge, I have gained a wealth of experiences and developed a mindset that allows me to effectively cope with problems that arise. I understand that learning is a continuous process and that practice and trial and error are essential to gaining expertise in any field.												
												By constantly seeking new opportunities to learn, I have gained valuable insights and experiences that have helped me grow both personally and professionally. I am committed to continuing to expand my knowledge and skills and to using my experiences to help others achieve their goals as well. </p>
